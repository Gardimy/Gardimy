### Hi there I'm Gardimy Charles!ðŸ‘‹

I have a goal to work as the lead developer for a big tech company one day. I previously worked as a freelance developer where I learned how to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS , and I have built 3 strong App since I started last year. Currently, I am studying at Microverse, an online training school where I code 8 hours a day remotely with other developers and have learned the skills of communication and teamwork. I am really excited about the opportunity to work remotely with a strong tech company and I am proud of the steps I am taking to achieve this. Would you like to discuss further with me?
